# MitiMind – 2025-09-02

AI in Trade Finance
- Finom has rolled out an AI accountant for German customers, embedding generative AI into SME financial workflows and bookkeeping products. [Source](https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/106885/finom-rolls-out-ai-accountant-for-german-customers?utm_medium=rssfinextra&utm_source=finextrafeed)
What this means for us
- Expect customer demand for embedded automation (reconciliations, invoice classification, summaries). Consider pilots that focus on accuracy, auditability, and data residency rather than broad feature launches.

Tip of the Week
- When evaluating LLM vendors, prefer providers that offer regional data residency to meet local compliance and reduce data-exposure risk. OpenAI recently announced Europe and Asia data-residency options.

Internal Spotlight
- No nominated project this week — proposed safe experiment: Run a 2-week pilot that uses redacted or synthetic trade documents to test an AI-assisted invoice classification workflow. Measure precision/recall, time saved, and log all model inputs/outputs for audit. For vendor selection, prioritize models with explicit data-residency and no-training-on-customer-data options.
