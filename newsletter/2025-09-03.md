1) AI in Trade Finance
OpenAI announced data residency in Europe, saying it builds on its enterprise-grade data privacy, security, and compliance programs so customer data can be stored and processed in-region. [Source](https://openai.com/index/introducing-data-residency-in-europe)

What this means for us
- We can evaluate Europe-resident model deployments as an option for handling EU trade data to reduce cross-border data transfer risk and support GDPR-aligned controls. [Source](https://openai.com/index/introducing-data-residency-in-europe)
- Immediate actions: add ‚Äúdata residency available‚Äù to our vendor checklist, engage Legal/Compliance on requirements for in-region processing, and scope a small pilot using synthetic/anonymized trade documents.

2) Tip of the Week
When adding LLM-assisted workflows, enforce prompt/output logging and a mandatory human review step for any decision that affects credit, payments, or compliance. Logs make audits and model governance feasible while human review limits risk.

3) Internal Spotlight
Small, safe pilot: run an anonymized-document summarization test using non-sensitive historical trade documents (PII removed). Metrics: time saved per document, accuracy vs. human summary, and number of review edits. Keep results and raw outputs offline and share aggregated findings only.
