AI in Trade Finance
OpenAI announced data residency in Europe, saying it builds on its enterprise-grade data privacy, security, and compliance programs so customer data can be stored and processed in-region. [Source](https://openai.com/index/introducing-data-residency-in-europe)

What this means for us
- We can evaluate Europe-resident model deployments as an option for handling EU trade data to reduce cross-border data transfer risk and support GDPR-aligned controls. [Source](https://openai.com/index/introducing-data-residency-in-europe)
- Immediate actions: add “data residency available” to our vendor checklist, engage Legal/Compliance on requirements for in-region processing, and scope a small pilot using synthetic/anonymized trade documents.

Tip of the Week
When validating models against trade documents, use synthetic or redacted samples, keep prompt and schema templates in version control, and log model inputs/outputs (with retention limits). This reduces leakage risk and makes behavior reproducible.

Internal Spotlight
No submission this week — suggested safe experiment:
- 4-week pilot: Europe-resident LLM for automated document classification (BLs/invoices).
- Data: fully synthetic + small, redacted holdout set.
- Success metrics: classification precision >90% on key fields, average latency <1s per doc, no raw customer data stored outside the EU.
- Owners: Product, Compliance, and ML Engineer; weekly check-ins.
