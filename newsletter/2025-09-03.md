1) AI in Trade Finance â€” OpenAI data residency (Europe)
OpenAI announced data residency for Europe, extending its enterprise-grade privacy, security, and compliance offerings to let customers keep data in-region for model use and fine-tuning [Source](https://openai.com/index/introducing-data-residency-in-europe).  
What this means for us: this reduces a barrier for EU-based customers concerned about cross-border data flows and regulatory compliance when using cloud-hosted AI. Consider data-residency options when proposing AI-enabled features to European clients (e.g., document summarization, KYC assist).

2) Tip of the Week
When adding LLM-assisted workflows, enforce prompt/output logging and a mandatory human review step for any decision that affects credit, payments, or compliance. Logs make audits and model governance feasible while human review limits risk.

3) Internal Spotlight (suggested experiment)
Small, safe pilot: run an anonymized-document summarization test using non-sensitive historical trade documents (PII removed). Metrics: time saved per document, accuracy vs. human summary, and number of review edits. Keep results and raw outputs offline and share aggregated findings only.
