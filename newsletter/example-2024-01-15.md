**What this means for us**: As we transition to PLD, this technology could automate document processing in our trade finance workflows, freeing up cross-functional teams to focus on customer value rather than manual data entry. Consider a pilot project to test automated invoice processing.

## Tip of the Week

**Start Small with AI Experiments** - Rather than planning large AI initiatives, successful product-led organizations begin with minimal viable AI features. Test one automation, measure customer impact, then iterate. This mirrors our PLD approach of rapid experimentation and data-driven decisions.

## Internal Spotlight

**Suggested Experiment**: Create an AI-powered trade finance glossary bot that helps new team members understand industry terminology. This supports autonomous team onboarding while demonstrating practical AI value across departments.
