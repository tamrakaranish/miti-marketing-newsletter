AI in Trade Finance
‚Ä¢ Finom has rolled out an AI accountant for German customers, embedding generative AI into SME financial workflows and bookkeeping products. <https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/106885/finom-rolls-out-ai-accountant-for-german-customers?utm_medium=rssfinextra&utm_source=finextrafeed|Source>
What this means for us
‚Ä¢ Expect customer demand for embedded automation (reconciliations, invoice classification, summaries). Consider pilots that focus on accuracy, auditability, and data residency rather than broad feature launches.

Tip of the Week
‚Ä¢ When evaluating LLM vendors, prefer providers that offer regional data residency to meet local compliance and reduce data-exposure risk. OpenAI recently announced Europe and Asia data-residency options. <https://openai.com/index/introducing-data-residency-in-europe|Source: Europe> <https://openai.com/index/introducing-data-residency-in-asia|Source: Asia>

Internal Spotlight
‚Ä¢ No nominated project this week ‚Äî proposed safe experiment: Run a 2-week pilot that uses redacted or synthetic trade documents to test an AI-assisted invoice classification workflow. Measure precision/recall, time saved, and log all model inputs/outputs for audit. For vendor selection, prioritize models with explicit data-residency and no-training-on-customer-data options. <https://openai.com/index/introducing-data-residency-in-europe|Source: Europe data residency>
