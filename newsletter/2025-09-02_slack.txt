1) AI in Trade Finance
‚Ä¢ OpenAI has launched data residency in Europe to extend enterprise-grade data privacy, security, and compliance for customers using its models in-region (<https://openai.com/index/introducing-data-residency-in-europe|Source>).
What this means for us: we can evaluate onshore model-hosting options for European trade-finance workloads, update vendor risk assessments and data-flow diagrams, and prioritize pilots that keep sensitive trade documents within the EU region (see pilot idea below).

2) Tip of the Week
‚Ä¢ Redact or tokenise PII and account numbers before sending documents to external LLMs; prefer region-specific hosting where available to reduce regulatory risk (<https://openai.com/index/introducing-data-residency-in-europe|Source>).

3) Internal Spotlight
‚Ä¢ No submission this week ‚Äî suggested safe experiment: run a 2-week extraction pilot using only synthetic or redacted invoices to measure automated data capture accuracy vs manual entry. If we need customization, note OpenAI offers enterprise fine-tuning support partnerships (for consideration when scaling) (<https://openai.com/index/openai-partners-with-scale-to-provide-support-for-enterprises-fine-tuning-models|Source>).
