1) AI in Trade Finance
‚Ä¢ OpenAI announced data residency in Europe, building on its enterprise privacy, security, and compliance programs ‚Äî enabling customers to keep data and model activity within EU-hosted infrastructure <https://openai.com/index/introducing-data-residency-in-europe|Source>.
What this means for us: We can more confidently evaluate hosted LLM features for EU-based customers that require data locality. Next steps: inventory EU customer residency requirements and map which product features would need EU-hosted model calls before any procurement decisions.

2) Tip of the Week
‚Ä¢ When building LLM-driven document extraction, always use synthetic or anonymized training data and a strict PII-scrubbing pipeline before any model fine-tuning or prompt logs. This reduces compliance risk and helps safe evaluation in sandboxes. (Internal best practice ‚Äî no external claims cited.)

3) Internal Spotlight
‚Ä¢ No spotlight provided. Suggested experiment (small & safe): run an anonymized pilot that processes 100 synthetic trade documents through a model endpoint hosted in an EU sandbox, log outputs and errors, and measure extraction accuracy + false positives. Use only synthetic/anonymized data and ensure logs exclude real PII.
