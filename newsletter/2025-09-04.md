1) AI in Trade Finance
- Paper: "Rethinking Data Protection in the (Generative) AI Era" proposes a four-level taxonomy for protecting data in AI systems ‚Äî non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability ‚Äî and argues traditional data-protection approaches are insufficient for generative AI pipelines [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03034).
What this means for us:
- Map our data flows (training data, prompts, outputs, model artifacts) to the taxonomy, verify traceability for audit requests, and confirm deletability and privacy controls for retained prompt/output logs used in model tuning. This is a near-term compliance and engineering priority for product and security teams [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03034).

2) Tip of the Week
- KV-cache compression can substantially reduce memory during LLM decoding. The GVote method reports ~2√ó memory reduction while maintaining accuracy by adapting cache budgets to predicted future queries ‚Äî consider tracking KV-cache usage and evaluating adaptive strategies in our inference stack [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03136).

3) Internal Spotlight (suggested safe experiment)
- Run a 2-week "Data Protection Mapping" pilot on non-production logs: classify stored tokens/prompts against the four-level taxonomy, test traceability (who/when) and a deletability workflow on a sampled dataset, and report gaps and estimated effort to productionize fixes. No customer PII or production models.

4) Quick Hits
- Study: LLMs can be purposefully steered to lie (distinct from hallucination); authors provide mechanistic analysis and steering vectors [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03518).
- Survey: Human-AI collaboration success depends on human-centered design, not just stronger models ‚Äî useful guidance for UX on assistant features [Source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04931).
- Industry: Tap Global integrates tell.money open-banking gateway ‚Äî potential signal of continued open-banking partner demand in payments/rails [Source](https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/106917/tap-global-implements-open-banking-gateway-with-tellmoney).
